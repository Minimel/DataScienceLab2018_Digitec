# Improving Shopping at Galaxus-Digitec - Data Science Lab

The goal of this project is to provide clients of Digitec/Galaxus with a reduced set of products that fits their criteria
as fast as possible, by choosing the best sequence of questions/filters to ask.

The different steps of our project are describes here. Details on how to access the data from the virtual machine are explained further down.

## Data extraction preprocessing ('utils' subfolder)
The main script to get the necessary data for our algorithms is `init_dataframes.py`. This script can only be run on Digitec's machine as it assumes a connection to the Digitec database.

## Stage 1 - Greedy algorithm - Max Mutual Information Algorithm ('greedy' subfolder)
Max_MI algorithm: Greedy algorith that selects the next question/filter by maximizing the varying component of the mutual entropy.
Baseline algorithm: Next question/filter asked is chosen randomly from the set available questions in the updates product subset.

For the MAx_MI algorithm, run `greedy/evaluation_eliminate.py`\\
Arguments that can be added are
- -s (number of products to test on)
- -hist (Boolean to indicate whether to use history data)
- -a (parameter to determine the importance given to history data)
- -pidk (probability of user answering I don't know to a question)
- -p2a (probability of user giving 2 answers to a question)
- -p3a (probability of user giving 3 answers to a question)
The results obtained will be compared with the random baseline

## Stage 2 - Imitation Learning - DAgger algorithm ('dagger' subfolder)
We used imitation learning (an alternative to reinforcement learning for learning sequential decision-making policies) to
train our model to choose the most appropriate next question/filter, using the data generated by our greedy Max MI algoritm.\\

Run `dagger/dagger_main.py`
